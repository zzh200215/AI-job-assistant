# Engineering Quality

This repository includes a lightweight delivery-quality baseline for demo, review, and resume presentation.

## Backend observability

- Every API response returns `X-Request-ID`.
- Frontend requests now send `X-Request-ID` by default for traceability.
- Backend logs include `request_id`, HTTP status, and request duration.
- `/api/system/overview` exposes:
  - business entity counts
  - in-memory runtime request metrics
  - embedding usage metrics and daily aggregates

## Frontend verification

- `npm run test` runs Node-based frontend unit tests for request tracing helpers.
- Task polling tests cover completion, cancellation, and transient-error recovery for async analysis flows.
- `npm run build` remains the production build check.
- `/tasks` provides a unified task center for async analysis progress, recent tasks, result navigation, and retry entry points.

## Task operations

- Async orchestration tasks expose normalized progress, current step, and duration metadata.
- Users can cancel running tasks from the task center with cooperative backend cancellation.
- Finished, partial, failed, or cancelled tasks can be retried while preserving the original task relationship.
- Startup schema bootstrap plus Alembic migration checks reduce drift risk for task-control fields.

## Eval Snapshot

Latest local eval run: 2026-06-24, using the current `backend/.env` provider configuration.

- RAG eval: `python scripts/eval_rag.py --top-k 5`
- Result: `Recall@5=0.920`, `MRR=0.922`, `Keyword Hit Rate=0.807`
- Lowest doc-type recall after seed expansion: `skill_model=0.769`
- Agent eval: `python scripts/eval_agent.py`
- Result: `MAE=3.0`, `Spearman rho=0.991`, `hit_tol10=10/10`

Interpretation: the eval pipeline is runnable end-to-end. RAG recall improved after adding seed coverage for `resume_template`, `jd_lib`, `interview_q`, `skill_model`, and `industry_report`, then splitting common `skill_model` roles into standalone documents and re-importing all bundled knowledge seeds. Agent scoring now has useful rank differentiation after removing fixed score examples and adding deterministic score caps for obvious adjacent-role weak-fit cases. Treat these numbers as the current baseline, not as a final product-quality claim.

## Eval Gate

Run the quality gate from the repository root:

```powershell
./scripts/eval-quality.ps1
```

To rebuild bundled knowledge seeds before evaluation:

```powershell
./scripts/eval-quality.ps1 -ImportSeeds
```

Default thresholds:

- RAG: `Recall@5 >= 0.85`, `MRR >= 0.85`, `Keyword Hit Rate >= 0.75`
- Agent: `MAE <= 12.0`, `Spearman rho >= 0.80`, `hit_tol10 >= 7`

The script writes JSON reports to `backend/reports/`, which is ignored by Git because reports are environment-specific artifacts.
Each run now keeps timestamped history snapshots such as `rag_eval_20260626_153000.json` and refreshes `rag_eval.json` / `agent_eval.json` as the latest aliases.
The frontend `评测报表` page reads these files through `/api/eval-reports` for history browsing and version comparison.

## Full verification

Run:

```powershell
./scripts/verify.ps1
```

It executes:

1. backend pytest
2. Alembic migration check
3. frontend tests
4. frontend production build
